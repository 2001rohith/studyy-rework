This project is basically a Learning platform, which is developed using technologies like Mongodb, Express, Reactjs, nodejs. I have used React for the frontend and Nodejs,Express for backend and Mongodb as database. There will be three kind of users Admin, Teachers, Students. The admin will be managing the other users like teacher and students. the Teacher will be able to add courses after admin verifies the certificate and can add course related features like assignments, quiz, notifications, live class. I have used socket.io for realtime notification and peerjs for enabling video call feature.
